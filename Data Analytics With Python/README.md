# Data Analysis on NHTSA Crash Survey Data

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing traffic accidents and fatalities using the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data. The dataset includes reports from 51 states in the US for the year 2016.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Fatality Distribution and Violations:** Analyze the distribution of fatalities in relation to different types of violations, such as speeding, rule breaking, hit and run, etc. Investigate the distribution of these violations based on accident location, land use, atmospheric conditions, lighting, and other factors.

2. **Drug or Alcohol Influenced Accidents:** Explore the distribution of drug or alcohol influenced accidents based on age and time of the day. Identify patterns and correlations between substance influence, age groups, and specific time periods.

3. **Injury Severity and Safety Measures:** Examine the distribution of injury severity based on the manner of collision. Investigate the importance of safety measures in preventing deaths and mitigating injury severity.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the NHTSA, providing detailed information on traffic accidents and related factors. The data includes variables such as accident location, violation types, atmospheric conditions, lighting, drug or alcohol influence, injury severity, collision details, and safety measures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
In this initial stage, the raw NHTSA Crash Survey Data is loaded into the project. The data is carefully examined for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Any necessary data cleaning operations are performed to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, addressing data quality issues, and transforming variables as needed. By performing thorough data preprocessing, we ensure the data is reliable and accurate for subsequent analysis steps.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The EDA phase focuses on gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and exploring its key characteristics. Various statistical techniques and visualizations are employed to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Through visualizations such as bar plots, line chart, world maps, we aim to identify interesting insights and correlations. This analysis provides valuable context and forms the foundation for the subsequent modeling and evaluation stages.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations:
In the final stage of the project, we summarize the findings and draw meaningful conclusions based on the analysis of the NHTSA Crash Survey Data. We provide insights into the fatality distribution, drug or alcohol influenced accidents, and injury severity patterns. Based on these insights, we offer actionable recommendations to improve traffic safety and prevent accidents. The conclusion also includes a discussion on the implications of the results obtained from the analysis and highlights potential strategies to enhance safety measures.

By following this structured approach, the project ensures a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the NHTSA Crash Survey Data. Each stage builds upon the previous one, leading to a clear understanding of the data and generating valuable insights to address the project goals.
